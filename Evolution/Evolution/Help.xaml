                Green cells are smaller than you, so you can consume them, increasing your size, and score. Red cells are bigger than you. Watch out, they consume you if you get close to them!
                Black-purple objects are antimatters, contact leads to decrease both objects's size. There are also two kinds of infection: one with the
                lightning emblem cause size decreasing for a while, the other one has an effect to your moving.
            Be quick! Smaller cells will disappear quickly, and completing the level will become almost impossible.
            In this case, orange objects come in handy...
